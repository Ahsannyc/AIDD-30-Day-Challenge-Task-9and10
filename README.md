AIDD-30-Day-Challenge-Task-9and10 
In this project, I created Claude Code Skills and Claude Sub-Agents that work together to write a complete book. 
 
Task 9: Skills are like small tools that do one job, one specific job really well. 
Task 10: Sub-Agents are like mini workers, each handle a part of the book-making process, each responsible for a bigger section of the book-writing pipeline. 
 
Together, they help automate research, writing, editing, and formatting. 

Task 9 Skills 
Skills are reusable tools that perform one jib well. 

1. Chapter Outline Generator Skill 
Helps create a clean chapter structure with headings and sub-headings so the book stays organized. Creates a clear list (outline) of chapters for any book topic. It helps break the story or topic into smaller sections so writing becomes easier.  
It tells you what each chapter will talk about so you never feel lost. 

2. Character Development Assistant Skill 
Explains the main ideas, characters, or key points so the content feels deeper and more complete. Helps create characters with personality, background, goals, and problems.Strong characters make stories interesting and believable. 

3. Plot Consistency Checker Skill 
Checks the story for mistakes, contradictions, or things that don’t make sense. Checks if chapters connect smoothly and nothing in the story or explanation feels confusing or broken. Readers notice when the story breaks its own rules. This tool keeps everything logical. 

4. Research & Fact-Checking Skill 
Finds background information needed for the book (history, facts, definitions, etc.). Finds correct info, background details, and verifies facts so the writing is accurate.  Makes the book accurate, realistic, and trustworthy. 

5. Grammar & Style Enhancer Skill 
Makes writing cleaner and easy to read. Fixes grammar, improves sentences, and keeps the writing style the same in every chapter. Good writing feels smooth and professional. 

Task 10 Sub-Agents 
Sub-Agents are bigger workers than skills. Each one handles part of the full “book pipeline.” 

1. Main Orchestrator Agent 
Acts like the manager. It tells all the other sub-agents what to do and in which order. acts like a team leader. When you ask for a big task (like “write a book”), the main agent decides which sub-agents should help, sends them to work, gathers their results, and puts everything back together. Without a manager, the project becomes messy. 

2. Research Sub-Agent 
this agent’s job is to go look things up, gather facts or background info, and return organized research results. Ideal when you need sources or context for a chapter or idea. Collects facts, data, explanations, examples, and references. The book becomes more accurate and useful. 

3. Writing Sub-Agent 
using output (e.g. from the research agent), it drafts content like chapters, scenes, or sections according to your writing style/preferences. Helps keep writing focused and consistent. Writes the chapters using the outline. This is the “content creator” that produces the actual text. 

4. Editing Sub-Agent (Formatting) 
once there’s rough content, this agent cleans it up: fixes grammar or style, enforces formatting rules (paragraph length, headings, etc.), makes content neat and polished. Cleans the writing, fixes errors, improves sentences, and checks logic. It makes the book polished and professional.  
Makes the final output look neat (headings, spacing, styles, layout). 
A readable format makes the book feel complete and ready to publish. 

5. Fact-Checking Agent  
this agent reviews the content (especially after writing) to check facts, consistency (e.g. character names, plot timeline, references), and flags issues or mismatches. Useful for books with research or complex plots. (You’d design this agent yourself.) 

Conclusion 
By combining Skills (small expert tools) and Sub-Agents (big specialized workers), the entire book-writing workflow becomes automatic. 
Each part of the system has a clear job, and when they work together, they can research, outline, write, edit, and format a complete book with minimal effort.
